# Introduction

This project is the result of two consecutive university assignments. The first iteration was for the course Web Technology at Saxion, creating a Server-Client application using the JAX-RS implementation Jersey and client side technologies like jQuery, jQuery Mobile and AngularJS. A website was created that allows users to browse and rate movies.

The second iteration was for the course "Data Science, topic 2: Semantic Web" at the University of Twente. For this assignment the website was enriched using semantic web technologies. The JSON datastore was replaced with RDF triples, which were then linked to open linked data using the DBpedia sparql endpoint at www.dbpedia.org/sparql. The enhanced website is just a proof of concept of this enrichment, showing movie title, abstract, directors, writers and actors in several different languages such as English, German, French, Japanese, Chinese, Arab and Russian.
